Creating a movie list application:
--In this section, we will create a new React application from scratch, starting
with setting up a new project with webpack and Babel. Setting up a React
project from scratch will help you understand the basic needs of a project

********npm init -y************8

--By adding the -y flag to the command, we can automatically skip the steps where we set information
such as the name, version, and description.

Setting up webpack::
--To run the React application, we need to install webpack 4
--and webpack CLI as devDependencies.

*************npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli****************

--add the start and build scripts to our package.json file

--start and build scripts to our
application using webpack. As you can see, npm start will run
webpack in development mode and npm build will run webpack in
production mode. The biggest difference is that running webpack in
production mode will minimize our code to decrease the size of the
project bundle.

--webpack so that this file is the starting point for our application. Place
the following line of code inside this newly created file:

--If we now run the npm start or npm build command at our command line,
webpack will start up and create a new directory called dist. Inside this
directory, there will be a file called main.js that includes our project code.
Depending on whether we've run webpack in development or production
mode, the code will be minimized in this file

--to check if the code is running
**********node dist/main.js********8
